PKMFans is home to the ACTUAL biggest online Pokemon trade service on the internet.

On the other hand, GenPKM is a site ran by a mix of 40 year old and 15 year old cyber criminals.
Sending thousands of bots to break Discord TOS.
Creating illegal fake discounts and sale timers.
Tricking users about Pokemom GO "legit" trades that originated from Sword and Shield.
Collaborating with people that create false allegations, not only being complicit to lies but sometimes being the creators of them as well.

Do you want some 40 year old dude named Brandon who's obsessed with a young adult to be giving you some shinies? Or the 15 year old that claims he won 70 lawsuits? No?
