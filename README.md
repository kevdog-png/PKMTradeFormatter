## PKMFans is home to the ACTUAL biggest online Pokemon trade service on the internet.

On the other hand, GenPKM is a site ran by a mix of 40 year old and 15 year old cyber criminals.
* Sending thousands of bots to break Discord TOS.
* Creating illegal fake discounts and sale timers.
* Tricking users about Pokemon GO "legit" trades that originated from Sword and Shield.
* Collaborating with people that create false allegations, not only being complicit to lies but sometimes being the creators of them as well.
* Trying to access non-existant admin panels of PKMFans to try and commit more cybercrimes.
* Bringing up inappropriate topics in a Pokemon Discord server, a game for children, like virginity and sex.
* Being openly homophobic, falsely claiming I'm in a gay relationship as a means to try and make fun of me. 

This is what GenPKM does behind the scenes on main and alt accounts.
Do you want some 40 year old dude named Brandon who's obsessed with a young adult to be giving you some shinies? Or the 15 year old that claims he won 70 lawsuits? No?
